This lab contains partial implementation of AVL Trees.

main.cpp : Creates an AVL class object, and calls the insertion operation over a set of values.
AVLTree.cpp : contains the methods to manipulate an avl tree.
AVLTree.h   : contains the interface of AVLTree class.
pretty_print.cpp : auxiliary file that contains the instructions needed to display a tree -- tree is reported on out in a similar way as we conceptually see them.

In order to compile the program simply type 'make' in the console
You can execute it with './lab'

Note: the code is not complete on purpose. Students must implement some functions in AVLTree.cpp. However, the code will properly compile and run without the missing procedures (it will work as a BST instead)

BONUS: Implemented! See all related remove helper functions.
