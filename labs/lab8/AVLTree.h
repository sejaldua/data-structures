 * AVL Tree Node:
 * - data is the value
 * - heigth is the heigth of the node within the tree, increasing 
 *          from lead upto the root.
 *
 * We're defining node struct outside the class, which is not good!
 * If the Node is defined this way, code outside this class can modify it.
 * This goes against the spirit of data abstraction.
 * We decided to do it this way because we are using a pretty printer Function
 * outside this class (complicated and indeepndent of the rest of the class). 
 * Keep in mind that this is a bad policy and not do it in your assignments
 * We will take deductions for abstraction violations when we assess
 * your submission.
