Lab 5: MAZES
Sejal Dua (sdua01)
16/October/2018

Description: This lab helped us to understand recursion and backtracking.
We solved a maze by leaving breadcrumbs and traveling in whatever
cardinal direction was viable.

Acknowledgements: Lab TAs

Files:
- maze.cpp: implementation (where all the code we wrote is)
- maze.h: declaration (includes lots of helpful variables)
- position.h: struct with cardinal directions and bounds tests
- main.cpp: driver

Compile/Run:
Compile by typing "make" and run with "./mazeSolver"
This will write the maze and solved maze to the standard out.

Outline of data structure:
maze array

Concept:
recursion

Testing: 
no testing required for this lab
kept a close eye on output and how logical it was
