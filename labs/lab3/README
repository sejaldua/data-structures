Lab 3: Stacks and Queues
Sejal Dua

Purpose of the program:
To get familiarized with dynamic arrays, stacks, and queues by helping a DJ create a party playlist.

The files that you provided and a short description
of each file and its purpose:
CircularSequence.cpp --- client which implements dynamic arrays in a circular fashion with a front index and back index
CircularSequence.h --- header file for circular sequence class
SequenceStack.cpp --- client which was built using the circular sequence class [LIFO]
SequenceQueue.cpp --- client which was built using the circular sequence class [FIFO]

How to compile and run your program:
make partyPlaylist
./partyPlaylist
at the end:
valgrind --leak-check=full ./partyPlaylist

Outline of data structures and algorithms you used:
dynamically-expanding sequence list
stack
queue

Details and an explanation of how you tested various parts
of assignment and the program as a whole:
checking standard out
checking for memory leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full ./partyPlaylist
