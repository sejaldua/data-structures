 *********************************************************/

This lab contains partial implementation of Graph BFS traversal.

search-campus.cpp: main driver of the project. Reads file, and ask for source destionation to run dfs
Graph.cpp 		 : graph class with extra helping tools to run DFS
Graph.h 		 : interface of graph class above
Stack.cpp 		 : simple template stack class used for DFS
Stack.h 		 : interface of Stack class above
NodeType.h 		 : interface of Nodetype class (a simple struct used in the linked list class)
Queue.cpp 		 : simple template queue class used for DFS
Queue.h 		 : interface of Queue class above
Makefile		 : information on how to compile the whole project
campus-map.txt	 : description of the Tuft campus map and all adjacencies. 
README			 : this file

In order to compile the program simply type 'make search' in the console
You can execute it with './search campus-map.txt'

Note: the code is not complete on purpose. Students must implement some functions in Graph.cpp.
      However, the code will properly compile and run without the missing procedures
      (it will not make a segmentation fault)
